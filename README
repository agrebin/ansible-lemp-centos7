To apply playbook on localhost:
```ansible-plabook --connection=local --inventory 127.0.0.1 --limit 127.0.0.1 lemp-playbook.yml -i ansible_hosts```

According to instructions in https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-nginx-mysql-php-lemp-stack-on-centos-7
this will create a default site, and provide either a domain name, or ip address, since getting the right ip address automatically can be ambiguous
it is required to either provide the right ip address or dns name and set it on server_domain_or_IP variable on lemp-playbook.yml file.
As default is setted with 'testserver' in that case and if you want to use this name and access it with localhost, edit your /etc/hosts file and add 
testserver on 127.0.0.1

You can also customize the mariadb mysql password by setting your mariadb_root_pwd variable
